    content: `ISS Consultancy recognizes the need to comply with the various laws regulating the processing of personal data.
            It is our desire that employees recognize the risks involved when dealing with such information and fully
            understand the steps that must be taken in order to minimize such risks. It is our organization’s policy to educate
            and inform employees about the dangers of inappropriate and illegal use of the personal data they may have
            access to.
          Whenever you are involved in processing any personal data, you must ensure that all associated procedures have
            been sanctioned by your manager. You must only operate within sanctioned procedures:-
           If for any reason registration of the information is withdrawn you must stop using the particular data
            immediately. Your manager will advise you of this
           You must ensure that your appropriate records are maintained and safe and are only used to perform your
            particular job
           You must ensure that all personal data is used, held and disclosed only for the registered purpose: you
            should not use any of the systems outside of this criteria
           Information must be collected and processed in a prudent and lawful manner and should be kept up to date
            and accurate at all times
           Information must not be transferred to countries outside UK without authorisation from your Line Manager
           The information should only be retained for the period necessary, and for the purpose for which it is held
          If you have any concerns or questions regarding the processing or use of personal data you should contact your
            manager as soon as possible. If in any doubt you should cease to process the information.
          A breach of the data protection regulations or failure to adhere to the ISS Consultancy’s policies could have
            serious repercussions for the organization and for yourself, if you are found responsible. It may also be treated as
            a serious disciplinary matter and may result in the termination of your employment. 
          If you are aware of any breech of Data Protection you must bring it to the attention of your Line Manager
            immediately. Any failure to do this may result in disciplinary action against you.
            If you have access to or are responsible for collecting personal information that relates to any of the
            organization’s clients or employees, the above guidelines should be strictly adhered to.
          As a member of staff, you need to be aware that ISS Consultancy will hold details pertinent to your employment
            on file as part of its personnel records. This may include sensitive information. This information may be
            processed for administrative or legal purposes or as required by your continued employment. This may include
            passing certain employment related data to third parties such as government authorities, suppliers or contractor
            organizations supplying services which require the use or creation of employee data (for example, payroll). Your
            data may also be used in emergency situations, to protect the legal interests and other rights of ISS Consultancy or
            in other situations where you have consented to the disclosure of such information
          
            The following are examples of information which may be retained by the ISS Consultancy as part of its personnel
            records. The list is not exclusive or exhaustive:-
           References obtained during recruitment
           Details of terms of employment
           Payroll, tax and National Insurance information
           Performance information
           Details of grade and job duties
           Health records
           Absence records, including holiday records and self-certification forms
           details of any disciplinary investigations and proceedings
           Training records
           Contact names and addresses
          It should also be noted that ISS Consultancy might hold the following information about you, for which
            disclosure will be made only when strictly necessary for the purposes set out below:-
           Your health, for the purposes of compliance with our health and safety and our occupational health
            obligations
           For the purposes of personnel management and administration, for example, to consider how your health
            affects your ability to do your job and, if you are disabled, whether you require any reasonable adjustment
            to be made to assist you at work
           The administration of insurance, pension, sick pay and other related benefits in force from time to time
           In connection with unspent convictions to enable us to assess your suitability in employment for relevant
            roles.
